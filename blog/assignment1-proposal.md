# Assignment 1 Proposal

How does our body respond to stress? This project proposes to explore the connection
between stress and heart health. Stress has been widely reported to be a cause
of heart related health problems (1). From a University Student's perspective we
often encounter stress when assignments are due and when writing exams.

This proposal aims to create a direct link between your heart beat and how you
perform while writing by hand. A heartrate monitor is connected to your wrist
and a modified pen used to write a piece of time sensitive work (think an exam).
The pen uses actuators to add difficulty to using it, for instance, vibrating the 
pen's tip or bending and moving the tip away from where you are writing. The degree of
difficulty added to the pen is determined by your heart rate, so either a higher or lower
heartrate increases difficulty depending on the mode.

While writing an exam if your heartrate increases the pen becomes very hard to
use. In an stressful situation this leads to a positive feedback loop, as the
hard to use pen increases your stress leading to a even higher heartrate which 
makes the pen even harder to use.
