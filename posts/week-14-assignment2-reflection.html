<p>Firstly, thank you everyone for an amazing course! I had a great time and I hope
you did too!</p>
<p>Also thanks to Ayesha and Harrison for being my groupmates!</p>

<h2>Reflections on our intervention</h2>
<h3>Show don't tell</h3>
<p>Our decision to allow someone else to interact with our project rather than
walking through how it worked ourselves was important to the project. It allowed
the class to discover the ideas behind the project. Watching Jono interact with
the piece was great and he reacted in ways we expected such as being frustrated
with the loading screens and surprised at some of the tasks.</p>
<h3>The small touches and performance</h3>
<p>The performance of the presentation was crucial to some of its success. For example, during
our presentation were asked if the web cam was actually doing anything. We
responded that it was, despite the fact it did nothing.</p>
<p>The small touches of the intervention such as web cam are what really pulled everything together.
Other things in this vein were the loading screens and animations on the drawer
LEDs.</p>

_Jono makes an audible sigh during this interaction with the loading screen._
<h3>A Blunder</h3>
<p>Our decision to use Access Canberra logo and name as our fictional scenario was
mistake, it changed the focus of the project from exploring questionable
machine learning and exploitation of human attention.

Instead people focused on
the satire of a trip to Access Canberra which was instead supposed to represent
a generic everyday place you visit. This is biggest change I would make to the design
if we were going to present it again. I'm not sure how it should be staged to avoid
this satirical element. Although, it probably needs to be placed in a situation where it
isn't questioned by the people interacting with it. Which is precisely the the
opposite of situation it was it.</p>
<h2>Other Interventions</h2>
<p>The other group's interventions were interesting, especially the group looking at
fast fashion. The laughter was especially evocative.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
