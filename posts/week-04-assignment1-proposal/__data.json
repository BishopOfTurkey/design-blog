{"title":"week-04-assignment1-proposal","html":"<h1>Assignment 1 Proposal</h1>\n<p>How does our body respond to stress? This project proposes to explore the connection\nbetween stress and heart health. Stress has been widely reported to be a cause\nof heart related health problems (1). From a University Student's perspective we\noften encounter stress when assignments are due and when writing exams.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to create a direct link between your heart beat and how you\nperform while writing by hand. A heartrate monitor is connected to your wrist\nand a modified pen used to write a piece of time sensitive work (think an exam).\nThe pen uses actuators to add difficulty to using it, for instance, vibrating the\npen's tip or bending and moving the tip away from where you are writing. The degree of\ndifficulty added to the pen is determined by your heart rate, so either a higher or lower\nheartrate increases difficulty depending on the mode.</p>\n<p>While writing an exam if your heartrate increases the pen becomes very hard to\nuse. In an stressful situation this leads to a positive feedback loop, as the\nhard to use pen increases your stress leading to a even higher heartrate which\nmakes the pen even harder to use.</p>\n<h3>Technical Specs</h3>\n<p>Sensors: Heart Rate Monitor\n<img src=\"/hb-sensor.jpg\" alt=\"heartbeat\">\n<em>Source: Jaycar</em></p>\n<p>Actuators: Servo Motors, Phone Vibration Motor</p>\n<h3>Rough Sketch of the Pen</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/pen.jpg\" alt=\"Rough Sketch of the pen\">\n<em>Heartrate Monitor on wrist connected the vibrating pen.</em></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/healthreport/mental-stress-and-heart-health/13674626\">Radio National Report</a></li>\n</ol>"}
